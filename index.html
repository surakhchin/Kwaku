    <h1>Final Project WRITE UP</h1>
    <p1>
Did the project come out as intended?<br>
Thus far the project is coming out as intended. For my project, I decided to film an info video with a brief demo of the product imbedded in it. I currently have a business website which needs a video component. My plan was to film this video and demo and insert it into my website for actual commercial use. To this end I believe I am successful. For the demo, I used a program called “Loom” which allows for easy screen casting. For the video, I used a cannon DSLR and a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus). Surprisingly, I preferred the video quality of the smartphone better than the camera. The camera also has a better microphone.<br><br>

What were major setback of the project?<br>
The main setback was around lighting. I tried filming both indoors and outdoors but I couldn’t get the proper lighting either way. This was especially difficult with the Cannon as the subject came out too dark or washed out. I still have difficulties finding cameras that work for dark skin tones indoors without expensive lighting tools.<br><br>

What ended up being easier r than anticipated?<br>
Acting does not come natural to me so I was dreading reading a script for my final project as it required me to be the main focus. I was especially dreading sounding robotic/stiff or looking like I was reading a script. I was pleasantly surprised that I did not sound too bad or overly rehearsed after the edits. Another thing that I found surprisingly easier or more pleasant than anticipated was editing. My project contains audio recording, music, video, text, and a demo. In previous assignments, I had issues with sound editing so I was dreading this portion of the project but found it to be more enjoyable than anticipated.</p1>
